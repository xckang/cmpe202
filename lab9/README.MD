- I chose Iterator before professor said not to. So there are two parterns here.
  - Iterator
    - QueryResults
    - QueryResultsIterator
    - QueryResultsInteratorImpl
    - Main.main1
  - Strategy
    - DataSet
    - BubbleSort
    - QuickSort
    - SortingSrategy
    - Main.main
- Summary
  - Using Design Pattern Style, ```Strategy``` is coupled with data class. It's more useful for complicate jobs.
  - Java Lambda Functional Style is more straightforward, ```Strategy``` is seperated from the data itself.
